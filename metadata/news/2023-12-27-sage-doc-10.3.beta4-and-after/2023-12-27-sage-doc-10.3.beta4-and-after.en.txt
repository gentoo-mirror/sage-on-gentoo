Starting with 10.3.beta4 building the pdf documentation with the useflag
doc-pdf in sage-doc uses luatex and requires at least texlive 2023.
texlive 2023 is not, at the time of writing, in the main tree but developped
in the texlive overlay.
If you want to generate sage's pdf documentation you will have to use the
texlive overlay or a manual installation of texlive
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/TeX_Live_manual_installation

For convenience, I have added two files in the package.keywords folder:
* texlive-2023 which has a list of package to unmask from the texlive overlay
and overlay setup instructions
* texlive-2023.license some packages needed from the overlay have new licenses
and this file details them and can be used in a package.license folder in 
/etc/portage or be appended to a package.license file depending on what you
are using.

Note that if you do not want to build the pdf documentation, you do need to do
anything. Building the default html documentation do not require anything out
of the main Gentoo tree.
