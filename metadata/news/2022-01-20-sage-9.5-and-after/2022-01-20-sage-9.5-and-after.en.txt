sage 9.5 is in its release candidate as I am writing this.
Some important changes are coming to the way sage is distributed upstream and 
in sage-on-gentoo. Upstream is taking steps to modularise sage and I am 
following their lead.
People who have been using this overlay for a long time will remember that
sage was split in several ebuilds before being stitched together in a
single one. In some way we are going back to that time.
Compared to sage 9.4, sage 9.5 will be split into the following ebuilds
 * sage_setup
 * sage
 * sage_docbuild
 * sage-doc
There will probably be at least a "sage_conf" ebuild for sage-9.6.
I didn't think it was mature enough to split it in 9.5.

To help manage these ebuilds a sagemath set has been created and is stored
in the overlay at sets/sagemath, see
http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/sets
for more informations about sets. The set can be linked in similar way 
that keyword and use files are to become usable. There will be updated
instructions for it in the overlay README.

There will be some changes to use flags as well. "doc-html", "doc-html-bin" and
"doc-pdf-bin" will be removed. The sage ebuild will have a standard "doc" flag 
to trigger the installation of sage-doc. html documentation will be installed 
by default. As it turns out it is a requirement to build the pdf documentation.
Binary documentation install will be triggered by a new "prebuild" flag.

Note for people brave enough to build the documentation in html and pdf in all
available languages: There is a race condition in make that manifest itself 
when building html and pdf for many languages. It became apparent when we
fixed parallel make for the documentation. Building with a few less threads
usually works.
