Gap-4.10.1 is ready and unfortunately upgrading is still painful.
I am hopeful that these pains will finally ease in future release.

If on upgrading gap (as a sage dependency or stand alone) gap-4.10.1
is not offered because of conflicting dependencies the quickest
way to resolve the conflict is to uninstall gap and all the gap
packages before re-installing again.

The following commands will un-install gap and all the gap packages
from your system

emerge -C gap
emerge -C `equery -q l  -F '$category/$name' dev-gap/*`

If you want to preserve your list of gap packages for quick
re-install after upgrading run

equery -q l  -F '$category/$name' dev-gap/* > gap_pkg.txt

prior to un-install. You can then use the saved file to re-install
your old list of gap packages.

emerge -v `cat gap_pkg.txt`
