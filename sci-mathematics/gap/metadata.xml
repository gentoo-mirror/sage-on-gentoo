	Groups, Algorithms, Programming is a system for computational
	discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group
	Theory. GAP provides a  programming language, a library of thousands
	of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
	language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP
	is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their
	representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial
	structures, and more.
