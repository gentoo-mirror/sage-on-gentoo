This is a software package for working with flat surfaces in SageMath.
We aim for this package to support the investigation of geometric, algebraic 
and dynamical questions related to flat surfaces. By flat surface we mean a 
surface modeled on the plane with monodromy given by similarities of the 
plane, though current efforts are focused on translation surfaces and 
half-translation surfaces.
Currently, the package can generate images of flat surfaces, 
plot straight-line trajectories, deform surfaces through the SL(2,R) action, 
and compute Delaunay decompositions. SageMath is used to perform exact 
arithmetic.
