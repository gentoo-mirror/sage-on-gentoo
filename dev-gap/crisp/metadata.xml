		The GAP package CRISP provides algorithms for computing
		subgroups of finite soluble groups related to a group class C.
		In particular, it allows to compute C-radicals and C-injectors
		for Fitting classes (and Fitting sets) C, C-residuals for
		formations C, and C-projectors for Schunck classes C. In order
		to carry out these computations, the group class C must be
		represented by an algorithm which can decide membership in the
		group class. Moreover, CRISP contains algorithms for the
		computation of normal subgroups invariant under a prescribed
		set of automorphisms and belonging to a given group class.
		This includes an improved method to compute the set of all
		normal subgroups of a finite soluble group, its characteristic
		subgroups, minimal normal subgroups and the socle and p-socles
		for given primes p.
